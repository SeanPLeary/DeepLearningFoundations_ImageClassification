# Project 2: Image Classification 
### Deep Learning Foundations Udacity

In this project, you'll classify images from the ```CIFAR-10 dataset```. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.
